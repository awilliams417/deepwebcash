Description: An implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol.
 Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to offer a far higher standard
 of privacy and anonymity through a sophisticiated zero-knowledge
 proving scheme which preserves confidentiality of transaction metadata.
 This package provides the daemon, dwcashd, and the CLI tool,
 dwcash-cli, to interact with the daemon.
